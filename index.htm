<p> Hi everyone! Thank you for visiting my web page! I am a senior at the University of Iowa studying 
Finance and Business Analytics and Information Systems (BAIS). I grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I 
three siblings. Two sisters and one brother; yes I am the youngest. All four of us are hawkeyes each
with a different educational background. My sister Shannon lives in Chicago. Ashley and Larry both 
reside in the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids area.</p>

<p> I am currently working part time at Pearson Education in Iowa City. I work in the technical support call centre. 
Before my call centre position I was employed as an intern with Pearson. I was a Project Management Intern with the 
Assessment and Instruction group. My duties included researching database migration strategies, learning the Pearson Business 
Model, suggesting the development of a risk management registry, and supporting other business units. </p>

<h2 class= "title"> Where I Want to End Up </h2>

<p> My dream job would be working for the United States Government. It has been a goal of mine since high 
school. Some agencies of interest include: 
<ul> 
<li><a href= "http://www.fbi.gov/Federal"> Bureau of Investigation(FBI) </a></li>
<li><a href= "http://www.justice.gov/dea/index.shtml"> Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) </a></li>
<li><a href= "http://www.ice.gov/"> Immigration and Customs (ICE) </a></li>
</ul><br /> 
I want to be in a position where the decisions I make combat society's problems. Any government agency would give me
the opportunity to do just that. If I am fortunate enough to be employed by any of the agencies listed my dream job would become 
a reality! </p>
